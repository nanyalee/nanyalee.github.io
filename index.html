				Dr. Nanya Li currently is a professor at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics and he was awarded an NSFC Science Fund Program for Excellent Young Scholars (Overseas) program. As a pioneer, he utilized microwaves to open a new door for the 3D printing of lightweight and customized continuous carbon fiber reinforced composites (CFRP) with high speed. With outstanding and innovative research achievement and leadership as an Alexander von Humboldt fellow at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), in 2020, he was awarded the Young Investigator Group Preparation Program (YIG Prep Pro) funded fellowship after being ear-marked as a potential professor candidate at KIT. After reviewing by worldwide recognized researchers, he won the 1st prize of "NEULAND Innovation" at KIT and the “JEC Innovation Award Finalist” in 2020. With those achievements, he proposed a “Helmholtz Validation Funds” project with professors at KIT. As a research mentor, he has supervised master’s and bachelor’s students in material science and technology, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. For teaching tasks, a lecture in both English and Chinese languages on “Design and Manufacturing of Lightweight Structures” has been conducted for undergraduate students. He has been part of the International Academy for Production Engineering (CIRP) community since 2021 and has been elected as the Chair of CIRP research affiliate in 2024.
